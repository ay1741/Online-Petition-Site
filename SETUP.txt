Hi,

I made this one day because my school had done something and I wanted it reverted so I decided to make a petition website overnight (I stayed up till 5:30 in the morning). I never released the site for that petition but decided it would be nice to give it out to people. In the future I hope to make it much easier to configure this for everyone's system. 

I hope you all like it!

Cheers,

Requirements:
To set this up this small petition site you need a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) server at the bare minimum.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Databases:
Once you have this set up you will need to add two databases so that you can have a place to store and receive your information. 
Open up PHPmyAdmin and head into the import section. 
Upload the localhost.sql file that is stored in the db folder.
Your databases are set up! Good job!

Connecting to the MySQL Server:
I'm sorry but I haven't set up an automatic way to put in the credentials everywhere yet. So we're going to have to do it manually.
First open up the comments.php, sumbit.php, and view.php pages and put in the DATABASE LOCATION, DATABASE USERNAME, and DATABASE PASSWORD in the locations it shows to do so.

Using database tables that came with the site:
First open up the comments.php page and put the database name as unitlunch_comment and set the TABLE_NAME as commenttable.
Next open up submit.php and view.php and set the database name as unitlunch_petition and set the TABLE_NAME as allset.
Your all set, you now have a functioning petition. Great job!

Not using database tables that came with the site:
You will need to change the put your own custom DATABASE NAME and TABLE_NAME
You will also have to set up your own tables, use should probably use the included DB as an example.
